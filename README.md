## Description

I built this Prework Study Gude to give myself a place to keep my thoughts organized while learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git
I wanted to get a head start in learning the basic of coding so that I can excel in the quick paced bootcamp. 
I beleive that I have a clear understanding of the basics, and that I am going to have an easier time understanding the content within the actual course.
One of the challenges I faced and overcame during this project was while developing the CSS portion of the project the values given in the tutorial did not make the webpage look how it needed to. I was able to adjust the properties as I needed by doing a little extra research about the different CSS elements and how the effect the way a webpage looks.
